This repository is a great resource to learn how javascript hashtables are actually used in javascript coding.

The file hashTable.js shows a simple implementation of javascript hashtable.
The file a+b=c+d.js uses hashtable in javascript to find non trivial roots of the equation a + b = c + d.
The file a3b3c3d3.js uses hashtable in javascript to find non trivial roots of the equation a ^3 + b^3 = c^3 + d^3.
